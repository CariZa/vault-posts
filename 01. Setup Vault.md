# Vault - Post 1


*Please note* This is a bit outdated, I wrote these notes about 2 years ago. I am just sharing the notes in case they help someone else, but there is probably a lot that has been updated since I first created these notes.

Setting up vault, the long way

This approach is the long route approach, trying to get vault working a lot can go wrong, this highlights all the steps that could go wrong, and eventually leads to the right end result.



1: Setup vault on kubernetes

￼

Just a note on the kubernetes cluster you set up, it will need to provide some form of persistent volume that the persistent volume claim can use. Most managed kubernetes environments will handle this out the box, when you set up your own kubernetes from scratch, you might run into issues if you don't have persistent volume options available.

I am using digital ocean's managed kubernetes, and it comes with Block Storage Volumes that automatically get created when you run the vault helm charts.



On you local environment, make sure you have vault cli installed:

Just for ref:
https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install/index.html

Download and install as package:

https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads.html

Test you have vault running:

    $ vault -h


Right now you have vault running, but it is not connected to anything yet. 

You can try test if you can create a secret:

    $ vault write secret/app foo=bar

You will get an error.


Vault uses environment variables to decide where to take action against:

2 of the main environment variables we'll set for this tutorial is:

    $ export VAULT_ADDR="http://localhost:8200"
    $ export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY="false"

Confirm the values are set:

    $ echo $VAULT_ADDR && echo $VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY

You still need to setup a vault server.



To setup vault on kubernetes follow these instructions:

Note: Remember to setup your ~/.kube/config (kubeconfig) file. Alternatively you can use the --kubeconfig="" argument at the end of your kubectl commands.

You will use helm, so you may need to set up helm and tiller. 

https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/ha/helm-init/

To summarise:

    kubectl -n kube-system create serviceaccount tiller

    kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller \
        --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
        --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller

    helm init --service-account tiller

*Please note* These notes are a bit outdated, they were written when an older version of helm existed and you had to setup helm with tiller. Chances are you can now achieve this without tiller.

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/platform/k8s/run.html

To summarise:

# Clone the chart repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm.git
    $ cd vault-helm

# Checkout a tagged version

    $ git checkout v0.1.2

# Run Helm

    $ helm install --name vault ./

(If helm install doesn't work, see above about setting up helm and tiller)


Confirm that vault installed:

    $ kubectl get pods

You should see something like this:

    NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    vault-0   0/1     Running   0          37s



Remember the environment variables you set up?

    $ echo $VAULT_ADDR && echo $VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY

We need to expose vault so you can use it via the cli:

Run:

    $ kubectl port-forward vault-0 8200:8200

This will make sure that vault on your kubernetes cluster is accessible to your local environment at http://localhost:8200

The environment variable VAULT_ADDR needs to be set to that http://localhost:8200

And make sure you have VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY set as true for this tutorial.
￼



Now quickly check if you can create secrets yet:

    $ vault write secret/app foo=bar

You will still get an error:

    Error writing data to secret/app: Error making API request.

    URL: PUT http://localhost:8200/v1/secret/app
    Code: 503. Errors:

    * error performing token check: Vault is sealed


Let's recap what we've done so far:

You've installed helm, tiller, and vault cli on your computer. You have installed the helm charts and setup vault on your cluster. You've set the environment variables needed for vault to connect with your kubernetes cluster. 

You now need to unseal vault.

You can run this command:

    $ vault operator init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1

Note: You can increase the values for key-shares and -key-threshold, and you really should. For simplism and ease this tutorial is just using 1. 

Make note of the response you get:

	Unseal Key 1: A+Ghv+KmcznGPRuEwXs9qAxpoVGecpQtwtWGVvMA1xs=

	Initial Root Token: s.3sOH3S5B626Yt6yksQdWTLlf

Make sure you store those values, you will need them.

Now you need to unseal vault:

Run this command an insert the unseal key you saved after running the vault operator init command.

    $ vault operator unseal <unseal-token>

You should receive a response like this:

    Key             Value
    ---             -----
    Seal Type       shamir
    Initialized     true
    Sealed          false
    Total Shares    1
    Threshold       1
    Version         1.2.2
    Cluster Name    vault-cluster-04c130fe
    Cluster ID      4d8965c3-df10-669b-d190-2f931adb0ffb
    HA Enabled      false

Now, let's try create a secret:

    $ vault write secret/app foo=bar

You still get an error:

    Error writing data to secret/app: Error making API request.

    URL: PUT http://localhost:8200/v1/secret/app
    Code: 403. Errors:

    * permission denied

You still need to log in with vault:

    $ vault login <your-generated-root-token>

Provide the token you saved (not the unseal token, just the Initial Root Token). 


￼

Note: Don't forget the "vault opertor init ..." step above this section before trying to unseal or login.



NOW Let's try create a secret:

    $ vault write secret/app foo=bar

You will still get an error:

    Error writing data to secret/app: Error making API request.

    URL: PUT http://localhost:8200/v1/secret/app
    Code: 404. Errors:

    * no handler for route 'secret/app'


We've done a lot of setup up until this point to get access to vault, what's now causing a problem is that you need to create the route for "secret" in order to use the "write secret" path.

Read more about this here:

https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/secrets-engines

Enable paths:

Eg path "secret"

    $ vault secrets enable -path=secret kv

Response:

    Success! Enabled the kv secrets engine at: secret/


Now write the secret: 

    $ vault write secret/app foo=bar

Response:

    Success! Data written to: secret/app



    $ vault read secret/app

Response:

    Key                 Value
    ---                 -----
    refresh_interval    768h
    foo                 bar


All we've done in this tutorial is setup vault on a kubernetes cluster. And as you've seen, it took a lot of setup to get it to a point where we could start adding secrets. 

Note: Just as a note, vault secrets are not the same as kubernetes secrets. You won't out of the box see secrets you add to vault appear as secrets in kubernetes. They're seperate concepts, and the secrets in vault are key value pairs that are stored on an endpoint we've setup that is called "secret".
