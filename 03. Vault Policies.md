Kubernetes & Vault

This is part of a series:

We need to create a ServiceAccount, this ServiceAccount is what we will use to bind our Kubernetes environment to access vault. The ServiceAccount will create a token, and that token once given permission, can be used to make authenticated requests to vault.


Create the vault ServiceAccount:

    $ kubectl create serviceaccount vault-auth


We need to bind the serviceaccount with the clusterrole "system:auth-delegator" (Please note - this might not be a great idea - I believe I made this choice at the time of creating this post because I was new to kubernetes and went with a default clusterrole - if I get a gap I'll update this and create a custom clusterrole with the right abilities - but don't do this :p upon review - this is not a great idea).

rbac.yaml

    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    metadata:
        name: role-tokenreview-binding
        namespace: default
    roleRef:
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: ClusterRole
        name: system:auth-delegator
    subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
        name: vault-auth
        namespace: default

Apply:

    $ kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml


The purpose of the vault-auth serviceaccount and the RBAC layers is just to give vault permission to authenticate itself on the cluster. This is not the SA and RBAC for accessing secrets or creating secrets. 


It's the "token reviewer" and you set this up in the kubernetes conifg.


You can investigate the clusterrole:

    $ kubectl describe clusterrole system:auth-delegator

This clusterrole is allowed to create tokenreviews

And create subjectaccessreviews



Now on vault we need to setup the kubernetes authentication backend on vault:

Make sure you are logged in as root

    $ vault login <root token>

Run the following command to enable the kubernetes backend on vault:

    $ vault auth enable kubernetes 

You should see:

    Success! Enabled kubernetes auth method at: kubernetes/

Troubleshooting:

(Remember if you get errors connecting to vault, make sure you have set the enviornment variables: VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY)

Also 

    $ kubectl port-forward vault-0 8200:8200

If you get "* permission denied"

Also 

    $ vault login <token>

List auth backends:

    $ vault auth list

Reponse:

    Path           Type          Accessor                    Description
    ----           ----          --------                    -----------
    kubernetes/    kubernetes    auth_kubernetes_2b1b990c    n/a
    token/         token         auth_token_b345d7b1         token based credentials


Before we start configuring, lets have a look at the kubernetes auth backend from vault's perspective. Run this command to get information on the backend:

    $ vault path-help auth/kubernetes


    ## DESCRIPTION

    The Kubernetes Auth Backend allows authentication for Kubernetes service accounts.

    ## PATHS

    The following paths are supported by this backend. To view help for
    any of the paths below, use the help command with any route matching
    the path pattern. Note that depending on the policy of your auth token,
    you may or may not be able to access certain paths.

        ^config$
            Configures the JWT Public Key and Kubernetes API information.

        ^login$
            Authenticates Kubernetes service accounts with Vault.

        ^role/(?P<name>\w(([\w-.]+)?\w)?)$
            Register a role with the backend.

        ^role/?$
            Lists all the roles registered with the backend.


config

You will see you can set a config. You need a JWT and Kubernetes API information. 

This config will tell vault how to connect to a kubernetes cluster:

    $ vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
            token_reviewer_jwt="xxx" \
            kubernetes_host="xxx:8443" \
            kubernetes_ca_cert="xxx"

In order to Run the above example you need these values:

A Token Reviewer JWT, we can get the JWT from the serviceaccount we create:

Get the name of the secret that the serviceaccount uses:

    $ export SECRET_NAME=$(kubectl get serviceaccount vault-auth -o jsonpath="{.secrets[0].name}")

Check secret exists

    $ kubectl get secret $SECRET_NAME

Get the JWT (base64 decoded)

    $ export JWT=$(kubectl get secret $SECRET_NAME -o jsonpath="{.data.token}" | base64 --decode)

Get ca.crt:

    $ export CA_CRT=$(kubectl get secret $SECRET_NAME -o jsonpath="{.data.ca\.crt}" | base64 --decode)

Maybe need to use?  | tr '\n' ' '

Get your cluster IP and add it as an environment variable:

    $ kubectl cluster-info

    $ export CLUSTER_IP=<YOUR_CLUSTER_IP>


Now you have all the pieces to configure vault for your kubernetes cluster:

    $ vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
    token_reviewer_jwt="${JWT}" \
    kubernetes_host="https://${CLUSTER_IP}" \
    kubernetes_ca_cert=${CA_CRT}

kubernetes_ca_cert can also point to a file if you use "... kubernetes_ca_cert=@filename ..."

That configures the kubernetes auth backend on vault to know what kubernetes cluster to connect to.

Example:

	TODO: Find a way to create an example request here

role:

	Vault works a lot with paths, and creating path structures, this kind of works along the same line. You setup a role path on the kubernetes backend:


Setup some roles for your kubernetes environment:

    $ vault write auth/kubernetes/role/example \
    bound_service_account_names=vault-auth \
    bound_service_account_namespaces=default \
    policies=read-secret,write-secret \
    ttl=24h
	
This kind of creates a bind between the serviceaccount you authenticated with and then the policies you set up. You can provide one policy or multiple (seperated via a comma).

We now have to bind a serviceaccount from kubernetes to policies on vault.

Note ttl = time to live, this is how long the auth token will be valid for


### Some more incomplete notes:

The rest is still in rough mode, I did not have time to finish off the posts. So it's here as reference in case it helps, but it might not actually lead anywhere useful. 

Let's log in with this:

    vault auth/kubernetes login xxx

Test:

    $ vault list auth/kubernetes/role

    $ vault read auth/kubernetes/role/example


Now login:

You login with the JWT & the examplerole you're given your JWT access to. "examplerole" becomes like the username, and JWT of the serviceaccount the password.

    $ curl --request POST --data '{"jwt": "'"$JWT"'", "role": "example"}' $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/kubernetes/login

Response:

    {"errors":["Post vault-auth-token-9222h:8443/apis/authentication.k8s.io/v1/tokenreviews: unsupported protocol scheme \"vault-auth-token-9222h\""]}

If you get this or any errors when you make the request, you need to just double check the configs you set.

    curl --insecure  --request POST --data '{"jwt": "'"$JWT"'", "role": "example"}' $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/kubernetes/login

    curl --request POST --data '{"jwt":"""$JWT"""","role":"example"}' -H "Accept: application/json" $VAULT_ADDR/api/v1/auth/kubernetes/login


    curl --request POST -H "Accept: application/json"  --data '{"jwt":"'"$JWT"'","role":"example"}' $VAULT_ADDR/api/v1/auth/kubernetes/login

If you get: {"errors":["invalid role name \"xxx\""]} 
You need to double check the role you set up 


If you get this error:

    {
    "errors": [
        "Post 35.204.123.86/apis/authentication.k8s.io/v1/tokenreviews: unsupported protocol scheme \"\""
    ]
    }

Vault is expecting just an ip with the https:// part, add "https://" from the config value "kubernetes_host"





If you get timeout errors, you possibly need to double check if you're using the right ip for your kubernetes_host you set. If your cluster ip when you run "kubectl cluster-info" has https, then you need to use https.

If you are getting errors anout connection refused

    {"errors":["Post http://34.90.3.38:32176/apis/authentication.k8s.io/v1/tokenreviews: dial tcp 34.90.3.38:32176: connect: connection refused"]}

There's an issue with the ca.crt you created in your 



If you add jq, you get a nice format:

    curl --request POST --data '{"jwt": "'"$JWT"'", "role": "example"}' $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/kubernetes/login | jq

You should receive a login token in the response: 

...
  "auth": {
    "client_token": "s.aSVRdfy9TbSsdrYfs09go7Ft",
...

You can do a vault login and test the permissions of the role:



    curl --request POST  -H "Accept: application/json"  --data '{"jwt": "'"$JWT"'", "role": "example"}' $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/kubernetes/login | jq

Example response:

    {
    "request_id": "72c02b5f-3d18-7939-d482-48d4ea2c2040",
    "lease_id": "",

    "lease_duration": 0,
    "data": null,
    "wrap_info": null,
    "warnings": null,
    "auth": {

        "accessor": "P6yhuPHx4Z38ZnyXwoIWQEUx",
        "policies": [
        "default",
        "read-secret",
        "write-secret"
        ],
        "token_policies": [
        "default",
        "read-secret",
        "write-secret"
        ],
        "metadata": {
        "role": "example",
        "service_account_name": "vault-auth",
        "service_account_namespace": "default",
        "service_account_secret_name": "vault-auth-token-8gh4t",
        "service_account_uid": "e8cb0337-1b33-11ea-ba34-42010aa400a7"
        },
        "lease_duration": 86400,
        "renewable": true,
        "entity_id": "b29e7dad-cffb-8074-3058-93ab1ce4aa06",
        "token_type": "service",
        "orphan": true
    }
    }


You can test and login using the returned token: 

...
  "auth": {
    "client_token": "s.aDz17IdVRIaQyoy8cZFTPs52",
...

    $ vault login s.aDz17IdVRIaQyoy8cZFTPs52

Respone:

    Key                                       Value

    token_duration                            23h30m22s
    token_renewable                           true
    token_policies                            ["default" "read-secret" "write-secret"]
    identity_policies                         []
    policies                                  ["default" "read-secret" "write-secret"]
    token_meta_service_account_secret_name    vault-auth-token-8gh4t
    token_meta_service_account_uid            e8cb0337-1b33-11ea-ba34-42010aa400a7
    token_meta_role                           example
    token_meta_service_account_name           vault-auth
    token_meta_service_account_namespace      default



You will see the policies added to this login:

    "read-secret"


If you require more permissions, you just need to alter how the policies have been setup for the examplerole, and for the service account.



Tests:

    $ vault list policy

You will get an error, you do not have permission as this user to view policies

    $ vault list secret

Response:

    Keys
    ----
    app

(if you setup the policy like that, it was a after part that we altered that policy) 

Also try the read:

    $ vault read secret/app

    Key                 Value
    ---                 -----
    refresh_interval    768h
    foo                 bar2



More debugging

    $ vault path-help auth/kubernetes
    $ vault list auth/kubernetes/role






Ok so at this point we can authenticate with vault from kubernetes cluster using a serviceaccount. 

We have an idea of the RBAC layer required from kubernetes side, you need a serviceaccount, which has permission to manage secrets and tokenreviews.

You also have an idea of the policy layer on vault, we create some policies, altered them, tested them. 

We then tested logging into vault via a curl command. We got a toke, and we were able to use the token to access vault and we were able to do what the vault policy permitted us to do.

From here what can we actually do? We have vault setup - tick
We can authenticate with kubernetes - tick
We can control access with roles and policies (and RBAC) - tick

Let's start actually doing stuff on the cluster that leverages what vault can do.

I'm going to continue this in post 3.
