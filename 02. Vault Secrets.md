# Vault - Post 2

*Please note* This is a bit outdated, I wrote these notes about 2 years ago. I am just sharing the notes in case they help someone else, but there is probably a lot that has been updated since I first created these notes.

If you managed to set up vault on Kubernetes, and you are able to connect to vault, then this is the tutorial to continue with. 

Else review Post 1, and confirm you have vault set up.

Make sure you have your kubernetes running vault exposed on port 8200

    $ kubectl port-forward vault-0 8200:8200

Make sure you have your environment variables from post 1 set:

    $ echo $VAULT_ADDR && echo $VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY

Check you can access vault and list the secret kv secrets engine you set up:

    $ vault -v
    $ vault list secret/

If you get errors make sure you are logged in.

    $ vault login <your-generated-root-token>


Setting up vault and using vault on a Kubernetes cluster is quite a journey. I've started putting together information to make the journey simpler.

This is part 2, and in this post we are just going to focus on some foundational stuff.

This is the stuff that will probably cause most of the errors and bugs when you start using vault and Kubernetes together.

You need to have a usable amount of knowledge regarding RBAC on kubernetes and policies and roles on vault.

Create a diagram:

    ***TODO***

Get to know:
- kubernetes roles
- policies
- roles


Start with vault policies and roles:

Create vault policies:

Lets create a few policies with different levers of permission:

A policy with permission to read the secret/ path
- read only

A policy with permission to read and write to the secret/ path
- read and write

A policy with permission to read another path
- read only

A policy with permission to read and write to another path



Policies are in HCL format

https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl




In Post 1 we created a foo bar secret:

    $ vault write secret/app foo=bar

Check this still exists:

    $ vault read secret/app




A benefit to vault is you can use .hcl files to store your policies in a version control system like git. 



Create these .hcl files:


read-secret.hcl

    # Normal servers have version 1 of KV mounted by default, so will need these
    # paths:
    path "secret/*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
    }

    # Dev servers have version 2 of KV mounted by default, so will need these
    # paths:
    path "secret/data/*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
    }


Check the format:

    $ vault policy fmt read-secret.hcl

Create the policy:

    $ vault policy write read-secret read-secret.hcl



read-write.hcl

    # Normal servers have version 1 of KV mounted by default, so will need these
    # paths:
    path "secret/*" {
    capabilities = ["create", "update"]
    }
    path "secret/*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
    }

    # Dev servers have version 2 of KV mounted by default, so will need these
    # paths:
    path "secret/data/*" {
    capabilities = ["create", "update"]
    }
    path "secret/data/*" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
    }


Check the format:

    $ vault policy fmt read-write.hcl

Create the policy:

    $ vault policy write write-secret read-write.hcl





CRUD

List polocies:

    $ vault policy list

Read policy:

    $ vault policy read read-secret
    $ vault policy read write-secret

To Delete a policy:

    $ vault policy delete read-secret
    $ vault policy delete write-secret

To Update a policy just overwrite:

    $ vault policy write write-secret read-write.hcl

Lets create two different logins to test the policy against:

    $ vault token create -policy=read-secret


Store the response token:

    Key                  Value
    ---                  -----
    token                s.Sjzjh5N6rxtaSrDwSlmRns3T
    token_accessor       dlM6tL6eGKj8hom7OPLLfkuL
    token_duration       768h
    token_renewable      true
    token_policies       ["default" "read-secret"]
    identity_policies    []
    policies             ["default" "read-secret"]

Then:

    $ vault token create -policy=write-secret

Store the response token:

    Key                  Value
    ---                  -----
    token                s.KHBtvfE7cUlqLoTYB0neQ7LK
    token_accessor       shvXaBLAhICeq0Ns0XRs45N8
    token_duration       768h
    token_renewable      true
    token_policies       ["default" "write-secret"]
    identity_policies    []
    policies             ["default" "write-secret"]



You will need to substitute the tokens I use with the tokens you receive:

Login:

Read policy:

    $ vault login s.Sjzjh5N6rxtaSrDwSlmRns3T

Tests:
Test other paths, eg policy:

    $ vault list policy

Error:

    Error listing policy/: Error making API request.

    URL: GET http://localhost:8200/v1/policy?list=true
    Code: 403. Errors:

    * 1 error occurred:
    	* permission denied

Test reading:

Can you list secrets?

    $ vault list secret/

Error:

    Error listing secret/: Error making API request.

    URL: GET http://localhost:8200/v1/secret?list=true
    Code: 403. Errors:

    * 1 error occurred:
        * permission denied


Can you read your secret you create: 
- app

    $ vault read secret/app

Reponse:

    Key                 Value
    ---                 -----
    refresh_interval    768h
    foo                 bar

Try overwrite the secret:

    $ vault write secret/app foo=bar2

Error:

    Error writing data to secret/app: Error making API request.

    URL: PUT http://localhost:8200/v1/secret/app
    Code: 403. Errors:

    * 1 error occurred:
	    * permission denied



Login with your other user, and test the other policy assigned to that user:


Read & Write policy:

    $ vault login  s.KHBtvfE7cUlqLoTYB0neQ7LK

Tests:

    $ vault list policy

Error:

    Error listing policy/: Error making API request.

    URL: GET http://localhost:8200/v1/policy?list=true
    Code: 403. Errors:

    * 1 error occurred:
        * permission denied

List:

    $ vault list secret/

Error:

    Error listing secret/: Error making API request.

    URL: GET http://localhost:8200/v1/secret?list=true
    Code: 403. Errors:

    * 1 error occurred:
        * permission denied

Read:

    $ vault read secret/app

Response:

    Key                 Value
    ---                 -----
    refresh_interval    768h
    foo                 bar

Write:

    $ vault write secret/app foo=bar2

Response:

    Success! Data written to: secret/app

Read:

    $ vault read secret/app

Response:

    Key                 Value
    ---                 -----
    refresh_interval    768h
    foo                 bar2



List secrets

So we've had a look at some restrictions for read and write, but let's update the read-secret policy to also allow listing of secrets

Let's quickly update the read and write policies, to also allow list:



Edit the hcl files:

read-secret.hcl

    # Normal servers have version 1 of KV mounted by default, so will need these
    # paths:
    path "secret/app" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
    }
    path "secret/*" {
    capabilities = ["list"]
    }

    # Dev servers have version 2 of KV mounted by default, so will need these
    # paths:
    path "secret/data/app" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
    }
    path "secret/data/*" {
    capabilities = ["list"]
    }


Check format:

    $ vault policy fmt read-secret.hcl

Log back in with your root user, else this won't work.

    $ vault login <token>

Once logged in as root user run this:

    $ vault policy write read-secret read-secret.hcl

Log back in as the read-secret policy user:

    $ vault login <token>



Run some tests quick:

Can you list secrets?

    $ vault list secret/

Response:

    Keys
    ----
    app

You will now be able to list secrets, and only see the secret you have permission to view/read.

You will also notice you were able to update the policy without having to recreate the user. Which is a nice layer of loose coupling. Policies can change, as long as they are still under the same name, you can alter what their permissions are, without the user account having to be altered.



Ok so we've looked at policies on vault level. Let's look at how to give kubernetes access to vault and to setup a role so that kubernetes can acces vault.
